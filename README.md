If you need IT support for sometihng Noisebridge related, and can't find help elsewhere, try raising an issue here.

# How to get help

This repo uses Issues as support tickets.  You must have a github account to raise an issue, so please create one.

## create an issue

read this: https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-an-issue

Include the following:
- How to contact you
- Make the title a short description of what the issue is, being very specific.  Use nouns, not pronous.  Should be closer to a phrase then a sentence.
- 1 sentence describing the expected resolution.
- 3-4 sentence description describing What you did and the result you got that was unexpected
- a list of all the relevent information you have
- a list of all the things you tried and their results, screen shots are great.

# How to help

- Get invited to the github organization (post here to request it if no one responds on slack or discuss)
- Please help document FAQs and stuff on the wiki and create links to the wiki.  Documenting issues and resolutions here is good, documenting the correct methods in one place is great, and that's what the wiki is for.

# Service Level Agreement (SLA)

There is no SLA.  This is a volunteer organization, and we who choose to help people are not getting paid to do so.  If you want to be helped, do not complain or be negative.  If you can, please help someone else with their issue.  This is not a top-down thing, everyone can help everyone else.
